1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Install necessary packages using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend project:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

#### 🌟 Integrate Spring AI

To add Spring AI capabilities:

1. Add dependencies in your `pom.xml`.
2. Configure any necessary settings in `application.properties`.

Refer to the Spring AI documentation for exact guidelines.

#### 🗄️ Integrate Caching Services

You can use caching for improved performance. Here's how to integrate Redis:

##### 🌐 Integrate System Cache (Redis)

1. Download and install Redis on your system.
2. Add Redis dependency to your `pom.xml`.
3. Configure your application to connect to Redis by updating `application.properties`.

To check if Redis is working, make a simple request to your application and observe the response time.
